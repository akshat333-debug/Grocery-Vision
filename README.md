## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Backend Not Running**: Make sure the backend server is running on port 5000
- **Image Upload Errors**: Ensure the image is in a supported format (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- **Request Timeout**: Try using a smaller image or check your internet connection

## Access from your phone (same Wi‑Fi)

1. Find your Mac's IP address:

   ```bash
   ipconfig getifaddr en0
   ```

   If `en0` shows nothing, try `en1`.

2. Start the backend (binds to all interfaces):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. In a new terminal, start the frontend (Vite listens on LAN):

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

4. On your phone (connected to the same Wi‑Fi), open:

   ```
   http://<your-mac-ip>:3000
   ```

Notes:

- The frontend is already configured to proxy `/api` to the backend, so no CORS or extra config is needed.
- If the page doesn't load, ensure macOS firewall allows incoming connections for Node/Vite (System Settings → Network → Firewall).
